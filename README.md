# Over-Voltage-Under-Voltage-Protection
 This project aims to develop an  automatic voltage  protection system  using   Arduino  ,  relay module  ,  voltage and current sensors  ,  and  LabVIEW  for local   real-time monitoring. Additionally,  ThingSpeak IoT  integration  is implemented to   send  voltage data to the cloud, allowing users to  monitor it remotely via a web   dashboard.
