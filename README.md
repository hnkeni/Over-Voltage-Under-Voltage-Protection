#  Under-Voltage and Over-Voltage Protection System with ThingSpeak Cloud Monitoring 
 Introduction 
 Electrical appliances and industrial equipment require a stable voltage supply for 
 efficient operation. However, voltage fluctuations can occur due to power grid 
 instability, load variations, or faulty wiring. Both  under-voltage  and  over-voltage 
 conditions can cause severe damage to electronic devices. 
 This project aims to develop an  automatic voltage  protection system  using 
 Arduino  ,  relay module  ,  voltage and current sensors  ,  and  LabVIEW  for local 
 real-time monitoring. Additionally,  ThingSpeak IoT  integration  is implemented to 
 send  voltage data to the cloud, allowing users to  monitor it remotely via a web 
 dashboard.
